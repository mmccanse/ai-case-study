# Blackline - AI offerings in accounting spaces

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company: Blackline

* Blackline was incorporated in 2001, and became a publicly traded company in 2016

* Blackline was founded by Therese Tucker

* Blackline was initially founded to help accounting teams improve their processes by replacing Excel with a suite of accounting software. Per the company's website and financial statements, Blackline's mission is: "to transform how accounting and finance departments operate, by delivering an indispensable platform to the controller."  Blackline accomplishes this by offering products that manage a customer's month-end close process (including account reconciliations, task checklists, transaction matching, and journal entry posting), automate accounts receivable, and automate intercompany accounting.

* Blackline is a publicly traded company. As of 10/27/23 its market cap is$2.98B. Funding sources are a mix of debt and equity, more heavily relying on debt. As of 6/30/23, its debt to equity ratio (long-term debt divided by stockholder's equity) is 7.86.

## Business Activities

* The specific problem Blackline aims to solve is the overabundance of manual, repetitive, and labor-intensive tasks that dominate accounting departments.  Part of this problem is that companies tend to house their various financial data in various systems that don't always talk to each other. Blackline's platform creates opportunity for companies to integrate their various systems with Blackline, thus allowing more streamlined access to relevant data. The company's goal is to be a complete accounting platform for the  customer's CFO team. 

* The company's intended customer is enterprise (over $750M annual revenue) and mid-market ($100M-$750M annual revenue) companies.  Per Blackline's Q2 2023 financial results presentation, the Total Available Market among large and underpenetrated companies is comprised of over 200,000 target customers, of whom 4,200 are current Blackline customers. The breakdown of potential Blackline products that the target population could be interested in is as follows: $18.5B Financial Close Market, $10B Accounts Receivable Market, $11B Intercompany Financial Management. 

* The solution that Blackline offers that competitors don't offer is usability, scalability, and AI incorporation.  Blackline currently leverages AI technology in its Intercompany Accounting and Accounts Receivable solutions.    

* Per Chat GPT, Blackline uses the following technologies; machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, advanced data analytics, robotic process automation, cloud computing, and ERP integration.  

## Landscape

* Blackline is part of the Financial Technologies market, specifically accounting software.

* The major trends and innovations in accounting software in recent years has been a demand for automation, and for cloud-computing.  In a capitalist landscape, there is ever-present demand for businesses to operate faster and more efficiently.  Simulataneously, the volume of data that companies must manage continues to increase exponentially.  Meanwhile, accounting teams experience pressure to maintain a lean head-count, and to standardize processes.  Thus, there is a large demand for automation options, to be able to both streamline and reduce headcount.  Additionally, the demand for cloud-based accounting solutions is often more cost-effective as these solutions (software as a service, SAAS) are usually subsription based, and a company can subscribe to the level of service used without having to purchase an entire software with components that will go unused. 

* Major competitors in this field include large ERP providers as well as accounting process software including Netsuite, Oracle, Sage, SAP, Workiva, and FloQast.  

## Results

* The business impact of Blackline is that is helps companies streamline their month-end close process, reduce errors, increase accuracy, and provide bird's eye view insights into a company's financials.  These improvements lead to cost savings, industry recognition, and customer satisfaction.

* Core metrics that the financial accounting software market uses to measure success includes how many days it takes a company to close their books at month-end (days to close), time spent on audits, percent of unapplied cash, and intercompany variances.  Of Blackline's 4,200 customers, 70% report fewer days to close, 50% report less time spent on audits, 99% report reduction in unapplied cash, and 96% report a reduction in intercompany variances at month-end.  Based on these metrics, Blackline provides immense value to accounting teams.

* Blackline is considered an industry-leader. Its solutions are not only effective, but also user-friendly and easy to learn.  Blackline provides robust documentation, support and training, and the solutions are scalable, thus able to grow as companies grow.  While competitors like Oracle or Netsuite provide solutions that are part of their own ERP systems, which can have advantages, Blackline is able to integrate with various accounting systems.  Its ease of use cannot be overstated.  Oracle and Netsuite may offer similar solutions, but their systems are clunky and finicky, often require significant manual work and work-arounds by the user, and there is often minimal support or documentation available.  FloQast, while very similar to Blackline, does not offer the same range of product offerings, and its account reconciliation solution is significantly less automated and developed compared to Blackline's. As a testamant to it's impact and success, following is a list of awards, per Chat GPT, that Blackline has been recognized with; Gartner Magic Quadrant, Top Rated Awards by TrustRadius, Software & Information Industry Association (SIIA) CODiE Awards, Leader in G2 Crowd Grid, Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies. 

## Recommendations

* Blackline has already incorporated AI technology into its Accounts Receivable and Intercompany offerings.  I would recommend that as they expand their use of AI, that they create a solution that can prepare expense and revenue accruals.  Accruals are journal entries recorded at month-end to record expenses and revenues that have not yet been recorded through established processes. For instance, an expense might not yet be recorded because a company may not have received the bill from the vendor.  Once the bill is received, the expense will be recorded through the Accounts Payable system, but often bills are received months after the service is provided.  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) dictate that expenses be recorded in the period in which they are incurred, and that revenue be recorded in the period in which it is earned.  The method that companies record expense and revenue that have not yet been billed is through the accrual process, which records a reversing journal entry into the appropriate period.  The accrual is re-recorded each month, and reverses each month, until the actual expense or revenue is recorded. Preparing accrual journal entries is time consuming and often manual, and requires consolidating data from numerous different sources.  However, accruals are often based on historical information, and potentially missed items can be partially inferred from budgets.  While accruals cannot be booked soley based on budgets, budgets can inform accounting teams if they may have missed an accrual and flag items to research.  A machine learning solution that could prepare accrual journal entries and flag items for research would save accounting teams multiple days of their month-end close.  Additionally, accruals are estimates, they do not have to be exact, they just have to be materially accurate, and as the actual expenses and revenue information becomes available in later periods, it creates learning data with which to train models. In addition to an accrual solution, I would recommend that Blackline create a variance analysis solution.  Most companies perform a month-over-month review and a budget-to-actual review.  Teams spend significant time researching variances and writing explanations.  For some companies this variance analysis is a SOX control, meaning it's a process the company relies on to ensure its financial information is materially correct, and that significant errors, inaccuracies, or fraud have not occurred. Thus, it's a crucial process, and is reviewed by auditors and senior executives and provides vital information. Yet, variance analysis often requires significant labor to prepare and could be aided by AI. An additional AI solution would be an AI model that can read revenue contracts and make determinations regarding whether of the agreement constitutes a contract and indicate how and when revenue should be recognized.  Revenue agreements can be hundreds of pages in PDF form, and can have significant nuance in dictating how to recognize revenue. 

* The above mentioned solutions would benefit Blackline because they would save customers significant time and labor in performing day- to-day accounting operations. These solutions would also likely increase accuracy and bring to light issues or anamolies that may or may not have been flagged by accounting teams.  Blackline aims to be a full CFO platform, and the above mentioned solutions are key functions in the accounting space.

* The above recommended solutions (accruals, variance analysis, revenue contract review), would require supervised machine learning, neural networks, natural language processing, and transformer model process.  

* Supervised machine learning would be used because the data provided would be labeled and fall into specific categories such as period or type of expense/revenue for accruals, period and GL account or financial statement line item for variance analysis. In revenue recognition there are 5 steps to determine when and how much revenue should be recognized, these steps involve categorized data.  For the variance analysis in particular, neural networks would be able to look at financial data across the organization and possibly also in the larger economic context to provide explanations for variances. For reviewing revenue agreements, natural language processing through a transformer model process would be needed to infer meaning and to classify elements of the contract being reviewed.
